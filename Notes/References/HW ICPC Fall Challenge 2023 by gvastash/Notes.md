- At any point of time if all RBG correspond only one cell and only one user, then $S_{nt}^{(k)} = S_{0,rnt}^{(k)} \times P_{rnt}^{(k)}$
- With above logic if two RBG correspond with different cells but the same end-user then $S_{nt}^{(k)} = S_{0,rnt}^{(k)} \times P_{rnt}^{(k)}$
- We can imagine the problem as a matrix of $R\times K$ and the cells is the total assigned power of RBG $r$ in cell $k$
